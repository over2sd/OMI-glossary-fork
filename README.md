## CONTRIBUTING

We're actively looking for contributions from:

- **Influencers** (aka applied memetics) - to be part of a network of active monitoring & field testing of idea propagation
- **Researchers** (aka theoretical memetics) - to develop the theory & design experiments that can be run in the real world
- **Software engineers** - to build tooling & infrastructure that can help with open data collection & analysis
- **Academics** - across sociology, psychology, digital anthropology, linguistics. To bridge the new paradigm to the old ones 
- **Funders** - to give out grants to promising research projects, or invest in companies that are shaping the memetic landscape in a more aligned direction 

As well as people who want to contribute to the open governance project of OMI itself (establishing the org, running it, etc)

_TODO: Add open collective donation link?_
