# Welcome to the Open Memetics Institute!

A network of humans that does self-surveillance is an "open memetics network".

This makes hostile outside interference visible, and improves the network's health by surfacing information that wants to be surfaced. 

A poetic way to think about it is a kind of communal self reflection:

> What meditation is for a one mind, open memetics is for a collective mind (subculture/company/friend group). 

A network that successfully adopts open memetics can be said to have solved the problem of marketing: the good naturally surfaces through existing mechanisms, and any attempt at manipulation of information flow lights up in all the detectors. 

----

The goal of the Open Memetics Institute is to describe what are the minimum social protocols & technology necessary to do open memetic monitoring in your network. It can be dangerous to transition from a network with a lot of hostile interference to an open, clean, self-monitored one. 

We're here to connect everyone working on this so we can compare notes, and grow the list of established "open networks" that can act as lighthouses / base stations towards forming the largest network of compatible open networks.

OLD DRAFTS

The goal of this website is to connect everyone working in this nascent field of _"transparent marketing"_ / _"open source propaganda"_ / _"open cultural engineering"_.

Most people working in the field of _"tracking & manipulating information networks"_ are doing so in secret. The Open Memetics people are the ones that do the same thing, but openly. 

We'll know we succeeded if we live in a world where:

- 🦠 When you see something go viral/mainstream, you can check its "propagation path", trace its history to determine whether it's organic or coordinated
- 🛰️ When each subculture/information network has an "open memetics base station" that does active monitoring on the health of the network, and acts as an ambassador to communicate with other networks' base stations
- 🕸️ When bottom up cultural propagation is normal - when any node can propose something to be broadcast to the entire network, and it does so if a series of people up the chain endorse it

We think something quite beautiful will happen if people chose to volunteer their data, and we could all see what we look like [in the global brain](https://www.organism.earth/library/document/global-brain-as-emergent-structure).
