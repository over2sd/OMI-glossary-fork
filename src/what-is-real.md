# What is real? What is true?

Everyone in ORI has a way to discern truth for themselves. "Subjective epistemology" is the highest possible epistemic standard. 

- If it has predictive power, then it is real (or has SOMETHING in it that is real)
  - This is how you know you got an "A" (from [A/B/U](A_B_U.md)). You should be able to say _"this is an A for me, I can tell because I can now predict something I could not predict before you gave me this piece of information"_
- We all exist in the same reality 
- The ultimate truth is invariant under all perspectives
